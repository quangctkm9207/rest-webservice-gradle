## REST webservice with Gradle
A simple example associated with [my blog post](http://emo-pass.com/2017/12/12/setting-up-java-rest-webservice-with-gradle/).  

In this project, PostgreSQL database is used to persist data. 
So, make sure to install it and replace your own database credentials in `NoteDatabase.java` file.
I am sorry for making it more complex than it was expected. 

### Run
```bash
$ ./gradlew appRun
```
